# TimezoneSelector
 A simple Chrome extension with a few buttons that manually set the value of an HTML dropdown menu (<select> element). This extension is tailored to a very specific scenario I run into somewhat often: a dropdown with a huge number of unsorted option that I need to find a specific entry in. In the future it would be simple to add a search feature to this extension.
